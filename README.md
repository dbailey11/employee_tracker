# Application Title: employee_tracker

## Application Discription: A CLI applicaiton that allows for companies/employers to track employees as well as roles and departments, including role salary. The application is run via the command line in the user's terminal. The usuer is first presented with a list of questions asking them if they want to view tables or add/update them. From the main prompt, if they choose to view employee/roles/deparments then they will be presented a table form in the terminal with the help of console.table. If they choose to add or update employees/roles/departments they will then be presented with a another set of prompts asking them names/titles/id. This application was built using node.js, express.js, inquirer, console.table and mySQL.
